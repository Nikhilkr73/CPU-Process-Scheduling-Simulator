# CPU-Process-Scheduling-Simulator
C++ program to simulate various cpu scheduling algorithms

A piece of code written in C++ langauge, which simulates CPU scheduling in an operating system. The 
following scheduling algorithms are implemented:

    1) First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
    2) Shortest-Job-First (SJF), with no preemption
    3) Preemptive Shortest-Job-First (SJF), with preemption
    4) Round-Robin (RR), with configurable time slice
    5) Preemptive Priority

Sample XML configuration files have been attached which contain all information regarding the processes upon which the scheduling is to 
be simulated and properties of scheduling policy (timeslice etc.)
